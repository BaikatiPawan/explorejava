        <h3><u>Introduction:</u></h3>
        <ol>
            <li>An array is an indexed collection of fixed no of homogeneous data elements. (or)</li>
            <li>An array represents a group of elements of same data type.</li>
            <li>The main advantage of array is we can represent huge no of elements by using single variable. So that readability of the code will be improved.</li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Limitations of Arrays</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Arrays are fixed in size that is once we created an array there is no chance of increasing (or) decreasing the size based on our requirement hence to use arrays concept compulsory we should know the size in advance which may not possible always.</li>
            <li>Arrays can hold only homogeneous data elements.</li>
        
        <li>Arrays concept is not implemented based on some data structure hence ready-made methods support we can't expert. For every requirement we have to write the code explicitly.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>With the help of collections we can overcome the above limitations</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Collections are growable in nature that is based on our requirement we can increase (or) decrease the size hence memory point of view collections concept is recommended to use.</li>
            <li>Collections can hold both homogeneous and heterogeneous objects.</li>
            <li>Every collection class is implemented based on some standard data structure hence for every requirement ready-made method support is available being a programmer we can use these methods directly without writing the functionality on our own.</li>
        </ol>
